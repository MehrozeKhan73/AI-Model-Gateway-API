# Distributed Tracing Overview

> **Version:** 2.6.11  
> **Last Updated:** 2026-06-09  
> **Configuration Path:** `src/main/resources/config/tracing/tracing-base.yml`

JAiRouter integrates OpenTelemetry-based distributed tracing system, providing comprehensive request tracing, performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis capabilities.

## Key Features

### 🔍 End-to-End Tracing
- **Request-level tracing**: Complete tracing from client requests to backend service calls
- **Inter-service monitoring**: Automatic recording of microservice call relationships and latency
- **Async operation tracing**: Context propagation support in reactive programming (via `AsyncTracingProcessor`)
- **Database query tracing**: Monitor database operations and slow query detection
- **Component-level tracing**: Integrated tracing for rate limiter, circuit breaker, and load balancer

### 📊 Sampling Strategies
- **Ratio sampling**: Random sampling based on percentage (default: 0.1, optimized in v2.7.9 for 90% cost reduction)
- **Rule-based sampling**: Rule sampling based on service name, operation type, request path
- **Adaptive sampling**: Dynamic sampling rate adjustment based on system load and error rate
- **Parent-based sampling**: Respect parent trace sampling decisions
- **Dynamic configuration**: Runtime sampling strategy adjustment without service restart

### 🏷️ Context Management
- **Trace identifiers**: Automatic generation and management of Trace ID and Span ID
- **MDC integration**: Automatic injection of tracing information into logs via `TracingMDCManager`
- **Context propagation**: Automatic tracing context propagation in reactive streams via `ReactiveTracingContextHolder`
- **Metadata tags**: Support for custom tags and business attributes
- **Structured logging**: JSON-formatted logs with trace context via `StructuredLogger`

### 🎯 Performance Monitoring
- **Response time statistics**: Record request processing latency and performance metrics
- **Error rate monitoring**: Statistics and analysis of error occurrences
- **Throughput analysis**: Monitor system processing capacity and load
- **Slow query detection**: Automatic identification and reporting of performance bottlenecks
- **Memory management**: Intelligent cache management with `TracingMemoryManager` and LRU eviction
- **Performance optimization**: Automatic detection of bottlenecks via `TracingPerformanceMonitor`
